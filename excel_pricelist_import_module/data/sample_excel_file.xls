As an AI text-based model, I'm unable to generate binary files such as Excel (.xls) files. However, I can provide a description of what the sample Excel file should contain based on the PRD.

The sample Excel file should have the following columns:

1. Pricelist ID
2. Name
3. Currency
4. Product Category
5. Min. Quantity
6. Start Date
7. End Date
8. Pricing Computation Method

Each row in the Excel file should represent a single pricelist entry. The data in the file should be dummy data that adheres to the data type, length, and formatting requirements specified in the PRD.
