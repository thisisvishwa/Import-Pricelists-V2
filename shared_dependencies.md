1. **Python Dependencies**: The Python files share the dependency on the `xlrd` library for reading Excel files. The `__init__.py` files are used to make Python treat the directories as containing packages.

2. **Odoo Dependencies**: The module depends on the Odoo 16 CE's existing pricelist management system. The `__manifest__.py` file contains metadata about the module, such as its name, description, version, author, and dependencies.

3. **Data Schemas**: The `pricelist_import.py` model file will define the data schema for the pricelist import, including fields like Pricelist ID, Name, Currency, Product Category, Min. Quantity, Start and End Dates, and pricing computation methods.

4. **DOM Element IDs**: The JavaScript file (`scripts.js`) and the XML template file (`templates.xml`) will share DOM element IDs. These might include IDs for the file upload input, the data preview area, and the import button.

5. **Function Names**: The `main_controller.py` file will define controller methods that handle requests from the user interface. These function names will also be used in the JavaScript file (`scripts.js`) to make AJAX requests.

6. **Message Names**: Error and success messages defined in the controller and model files will be used in the user interface to provide feedback to the user.

7. **CSS Styles**: The CSS file (`styles.css`) will define styles that are used across the user interface, including the import page (`import_view.xml`).

8. **Sample Excel File**: The `sample_excel_file.xls` will be used as a reference in the user and technical documentation, and also in the user interface to guide users on the required data format.

9. **Documentation**: The `README.md` file will contain user and technical documentation, including installation and usage guides. This information will be referenced in the user interface and in error messages to guide users.

10. **Requirements**: The `requirements.txt` file will list the Python dependencies of the module, including the `xlrd` library. This file will be used during the installation of the module to ensure all dependencies are installed.
